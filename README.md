## Synopsis

A social karaoke platform built with the YouTube API and Ruby on Rails. Pandapop was created by karaoke lovers, for karaoke lovers, to facilitate a more seamless, natural JPop-style karaoke experience when streaming YouTube videos. Users can search for karaoke videos without interrupting the currently-playing track, queue up their favorite songs, and build themed playlists for future karaoke parties!
